## Analysis of Scraped Book Data

In this project, we scraped data from a books website to gather information about different books. After collecting the data, we performed various analyses to gain insights from the collected information. Here are some key findings from the analysis:

1. **Top-rated Books**: We identified the books with the highest ratings based on user reviews. These top-rated books are recommended for readers looking for highly acclaimed literature.

2. **Author Popularity**: We analyzed the scraped data to determine the popularity of different authors. By considering factors such as the number of books listed on the website and the average ratings received, we identified the most popular authors in the dataset.

3. **Price Comparison**: We compared the prices of books across different categories and genres. This analysis helps readers find books within their budget and identifies price variations among different editions or formats.

4. **Genre Distribution**: We examined the distribution of books across different genres. This analysis provides insights into popular genres and trends in readers' preferences.

5. **Price-Performance Ratio**: We calculated the price-performance ratio for each book by dividing the rating by the price. This ratio helps users identify books that offer good value for money based on their ratings relative to their prices.

The scraped book data, along with the analysis results, can be found in the [data folder](data/) of this repository.
